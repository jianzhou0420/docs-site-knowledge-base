# Call It A Day

Summarize all work done in the **current work streak** by reading `.claude/log.md`. A work streak is a continuous run of sessions without a long break between them.

> **Prerequisite**: `.claude/log.md` must exist and contain session entries in reverse chronological order (newest first). This file is typically maintained by a `/log` skill that records each session's summary at the top.

## Steps

### Step 1: Get current time

```bash
date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
```

### Step 2: Read `.claude/log.md`

Read the log file. If it's too large, read from the top — the most recent entries are there.

### Step 3: Identify the current work streak

Walk the session entries from **newest to oldest** (they're in reverse chronological order). For each consecutive pair of sessions, compute the gap between them.

**A streak breaks when the gap between two consecutive sessions exceeds 6 hours.**

- Start from the most recent session.
- Include each prior session as long as the gap to the next-newer session is ≤ 6 hours.
- Stop when a gap > 6 hours is found — that's the streak boundary.

Example: sessions at 23:13, 23:11, 23:01, 20:04, 15:51, 15:08, 15:02, 14:17, 14:17, 00:52 — gap between 14:17 and 00:52 is ~13 hours, so the streak is the 9 sessions from 14:17 to 23:13. The 00:52 session belongs to the previous streak.

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a date (e.g. `2026-03-30`), summarize all sessions from that calendar date instead of using the streak logic.

### Step 4: Print the daily summary

Format the output as:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Daily Summary — YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM – HH:MM]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Sessions: N  |  Span: Xh Ym

1. [HH:MM] Session Title
   → bullet summary of what was done (1-2 lines from the Summary section)

2. [HH:MM] Session Title
   → bullet summary

...

───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Files touched: X created, Y modified, Z deleted
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

- **Date range**: show the date of the first session. If the streak spans midnight, show both dates (e.g. `2026-03-30 – 2026-03-31`).
- **Time range**: `[earliest HH:MM – latest HH:MM]`.
- **Span**: total duration from first to last session in hours and minutes.

## Rules

- List sessions in **chronological order** (earliest first).
- For each session, extract its **Summary** subsection and condense it to 1-2 lines.
- At the bottom, aggregate file-change counts across all sessions (deduplicate — if the same file was modified in two sessions, count it once).
- If no entries exist in the log, print: `No log entries found. Nothing to summarize.`
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and is not a date, append it as a "Notes" line at the end.
